[First NPC]:
	*breathing heavily*
	You there, traveller. I need your help.
	The miseromancers have stolen the joy of the villagers!
	I only just survived with my smile, but I can feel it fading.
	Please help! Make your way to the village and help us smile again.
	I wish you luck.


[First Door NPC]:
	[Pre joy]:
		Oh hello...
		What do you want?
		My smile? Oh yeah, I forgot about that...
		You're going after the joy? Why bother?
		Life sucks anyways.
		First your dad leaves, then your mum, and then your girlfriend.
		Even the cat left! Nothing is worth it anymore...

	[Post joy]:
		Oh my god! Thank you so much traveller!
		I'd forgotten how good it felt to smile.
		I assume you intend to go to the village. I'll open this gate for you.
		Oh, and if you see my dear schrodinger, tell him that daddy misses him...


[Second Door NPC]: 
	[Pre joy]:
		Hey, watch where you're going.
		Me? I'm just wandering. I have nothing to do.
		I've got no idea where I am but...
		I'm not too bothered.
		The rat shop was becoming a hassle anyways.
		Huh? You've never heard of a rat shop?
		Well... We sell rats... thats it really...
		Can you leave me alone now? I'm enjoying the quiet.

	[Post joy]:
		Wow... WOW!
		I can't believe I'd say that about my shop.
		I love my rats! They're so sweet and rodent-y.
		Anyways I'll open the gate for you.
		Please save my shop!


[Schrodinger The Cat]:
	...
	..........
	Meow...?
	*sigh* You got me
	I'm Schrodinger. I bet Barry sent you, right?
	Well too bad, I'm not going back to that loser.
	Everyone left him because he doesn't shower.
	Can you imagine? The smell is... something else.
	I'm not going back.
	I'm gonna sit here in this tree. You know what a retirement home is right?
	Now buzz off before I scratch your eyes out.

[Third door NPC]:
	[Pre joy]:
		Do you have kids? No?
		Don't have them. All they do is ruin your life.
		I used to have friends. I was a social butterfly.
		Then Tina and Phil came along...
		They hide in the cupboards! My husband had two heart attacks!
		Then the stroke came along and finished him off.
		Seriously, don't have kids.

	[Post joy]:
		Jeez. What a slump that was.
		Thank you for your help! I feel a lot better!
		My kids? Oh hell no. I'm not going back for them.
		I've got big plans for the future! Places I want to see!
		I think I'll move to Singapore. Come find me if you're in the area.
		I'll open the village gate. See you around!
